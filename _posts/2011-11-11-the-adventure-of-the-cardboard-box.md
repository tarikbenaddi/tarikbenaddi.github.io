On glancing $$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$ over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic: 

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.

They sometimes just want to be left alone.

As
Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He
glanced at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on
the floor. I picked it up and read:--
                              
>Charles Augustus Milverton,                              
>Appledore Towers,  
>Hampstead.  
>Agent.  
                               
"Who is he?" I asked.

"The worst man in London," Holmes answered, as he sat down and
stretched his legs before the fire. "Is anything on the back of the
card?"

“We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,” said the Colonel. “Why, what is that? Silver Blaze favorite?”

In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes[^1], I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents.
